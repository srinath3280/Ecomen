                            The mining sector will benefit tremendously by using digital, technology and data analytics to optimise operations, asset performance and reduce risk. However, to get this right will need to overcome the legacy operations which are often broken down into individual operating silos, with ineffective integration between mine, processing and transport. To overcome these barriers and achieve effective digital transformation, there must be a focus on foundational systems, processes and, importantly, the right capabilities and mind-set need to be put in place.
